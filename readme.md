# Formsender add-on for Vaadin 8

Simple add-on to allow doing HTTP POST calls from the client-side. Vaadin 8 port of [Formsender](http://vaadin.com/addon/formsender).

To test, clone the repo, run *mvn jetty:run* and browse to *http://localhost:8080/app*. From there you can do a HTTP POST to a separate JSP page.
